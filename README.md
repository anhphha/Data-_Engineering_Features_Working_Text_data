# Data_Engineering_Features_Working_with_Text_data

Arcada UAS | Project: Processing text data | Tools: Python | Project is about to execute analysis on text data

- Preprocessed text data (ETL) for analytics
- Applied multiclass classifier model (Logistic Regression), trained an SVM classifier for language recognition between these 5 languages, tested TfidfVectorizer  and CountVectorizer model on the dataset, compared the performance of these models
- Tested the models with different parameters, such as ngram, c_param, c value and number of data points
- Evaluated the results, compared the model accuracy when the number of data points changed
